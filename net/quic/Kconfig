	  QUIC (RFC 9000) is a UDP-based multiplexed and secure transport
	  protocol designed for HTTP/3 and general-purpose use. It provides
	  built-in encryption using TLS 1.3, multiplexed streams to avoid
	  head-of-line blocking, and connection migration support.

	  This implementation provides kernel-level QUIC support that can be
	  used by applications through the socket API, similar to how TCP
	  sockets work. Key features include:

	    - Multiplexed streams within a single connection
	    - Low-latency connection establishment (0-RTT and 1-RTT)
	    - Connection migration and multi-path support
	    - Congestion control and loss recovery
	    - Hardware offload support for improved performance

	  The userspace handshake is performed via the handshake upcall
	  mechanism, allowing the kernel to handle data transfer while
	  userspace libraries manage the TLS handshake.

	  To compile this protocol support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called quic.

	  If unsure, say N.

	help
	  Enable debug output for the QUIC protocol implementation. This
	  option adds verbose logging of protocol state transitions, packet
	  processing, and internal events to the kernel log.

	  This is useful for developers working on the QUIC implementation
	  or for diagnosing protocol-level issues, but adds overhead and
	  should not be enabled in production systems.

	  If unsure, say N.
