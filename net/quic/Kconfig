	  TQUIC is a kernel-level QUIC implementation (RFC 9000/9001/9002)
	  with multipath WAN bonding capabilities. It can aggregate multiple
	  network paths (e.g. LTE/5G/WiFi/wired) into a single logical
	  connection with failover and bandwidth aggregation.

	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called quic.

	  If unsure, say N.

	help
	  Enable debug output for the QUIC protocol implementation. This
	  option adds verbose logging of protocol state transitions, packet
	  processing, and internal events to the kernel log.

	  This is useful for developers working on the QUIC implementation
	  or for diagnosing protocol-level issues, but adds overhead and
	  should not be enabled in production systems.

	  If unsure, say N.
